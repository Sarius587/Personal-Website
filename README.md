# Personal-Website
My personal portfolio website using ASP.Net Core

## Structure
* Razor pages
* Projects are fetched every 24 hours from Github to store them into a database so that the Github API will not receive to many requests.
* On small screen devices you will directly be directed to Github otherwise you will see the Readme first
